A short story.

One day, Jirka and Priscilla were out riding their camel in the centre of Tallin when
they saw some ugly graffiti on the wall of a house.
“Can you read that?” Jirka asked.
“I think they were written by a Carlite,” Priscille replied, “and illegible.”
“Oh!” a nearby schemer remarked, “Those are just Carl marks.”
